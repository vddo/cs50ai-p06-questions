['The field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence "can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it".',
 'In the 2010s, advances in neural networks using deep learning thrust AI into widespread public consciousness and contributed to an enormous upshift in corporate AI spending; for example, AI-related M&A in 2017 was over 25 times as large as in 2015.The study of non-learning artificial neural networks began in the decade before the field of AI research was founded, in the work of Walter Pitts and Warren McCullouch.',
 'When Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov in chess, the machine was acting intelligently.',
 'Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1955, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an "AI winter"), followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding.',
 'When access to digital computers became possible in the mid-1950s, AI research began to explore the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation.',
 'When computers with large memories became available around 1970, researchers from all three traditions began to build knowledge into AI applications.',
 'When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.',
 '"robotics" or "machine learning"), the use of particular tools ("logic" or artificial neural networks), or deep philosophical differences.',
 'Faster computers, algorithmic improvements, and access to large amounts of data enabled advances in machine learning and perception; data-hungry deep learning methods started to dominate accuracy benchmarks around 2012.',
 "Machine learning (ML), a fundamental concept of AI research since the field's inception, is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience."]
